# Library-Database
A simple library database that includes code that 
- create tables
- queries


This project was created to test myself with the application of SQL.
Inlcudes the code to 
- CREATE Tables 
- run QUERIES

Used MySQL to set up and run the database in order to take screenshot examples of said queries.
To be improved with more Check constraints over time
