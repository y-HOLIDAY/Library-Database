# Library-Database
A simple library database that includes code that create tables, queries and ER diagram

This project was created to test myself with the application of SQL.
Inlcudes the code to CREATE Tables and code to RUN QUERIESs
There is also an ER diagram to visually represent the structure of a databaseâ€”specifically, the entities, their attributes and the relationships between them.
Used MySQL to set up and run the database in order to take screenshot examples of said queries.
To be improved with more Check constraints over time
